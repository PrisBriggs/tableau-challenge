Homework Module 18 - Tableau Challenge
By Priscila Menezes Briggs

Challenge history
I was hired as the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, and I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. The program includes bikes and stations from the cities of New York and Jersey City. In my new role, I am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, our team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Data Analysis

General Objective
My task in this assignment was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. 

Specific Objective
In this project, I analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the Citi Bike's bike-sharing program during the Summer and Fall months of year 2020, when vaccines were not yet available to the public. The results 
were compared with data from the Summer and Fall months of 2019, when COVID-19 had not spread to the world yet. 

Target audience
City officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City and Jersey City municipal departments. 

Programs and tools
I used Tableau to analyze the data and produce the visualizations. I used Jupyter Notebook to concatenate the datasets used for this challenge. 

Resources
I used datasets (.csv) from the Citibike webpage from Summer and Fall Months (June to November) from 2019 and 2020. The datasets contain bike-sharing information from Jersey City, NJ, USA. 

Analysis

I designed several visualizations and incorporated them into seven dashboards in Tableau. The dashboards are accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring. 
The questions below were some of the questions answered in this project:

- How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer and fall months?
- What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting and ending a journey? 
- What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting and ending a journey? 
- How does the average trip duration change by age?
- What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

A static map was also created, plotting the top ten bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
The map is also accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during my analysis.

All these results allowed me to create a Tableau story that brought together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards. The data and analysis were presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy to understand, and visually compelling. The visualizations are colorful enough to be included in press releases, and my analysis is thoughtful enough to inform programmatic changes.
All efforts were made to make sure that the presentation turned out professional, logical, and visually appealing.

Considerations
Screenshots were included as part of the submission material because the visualization in Tableau Public may not be the same as the ones created with Tableau in the local machine. 

The dashboards and the full analysis may be visualized on Tableau Public at https://public.tableau.com/views/tableau-challenge_16825299558450/Home?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Ultimately, the files used in this challenge are also available in the GitHub's repository on https://github.com/PrisBriggs/tableau-challenge.git .

All webpages were visited in April and May/2023.
